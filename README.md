## Abstract

Understanding how users authentically interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge in human-computer interaction research. Most existing studies rely on self-reported usage patterns or controlled experimental conditions, potentially missing genuine behavioral adaptations. This study presents a behavioral analysis of the use of English-speaking urban professional ChatGPT in India based on 238 authentic, unedited user prompts from 40 participants in 15+ Indian cities, collected using retrospective survey methodology in August 2025.

### Key Findings

1. **85% daily usage rate** (34/40 users) indicating mature adoption beyond experimental use
2. **Evidence of cross-domain integration** spanning professional, personal, health and creative contexts among the majority of users  
3. **42.5% (17/40) primarily use ChatGPT for professional workflows** with evidence of real-time problem solving integration
4. **Cultural context navigation strategies** with users incorporating Indian cultural specifications in their prompts

The study reveals the progression from experimental to essential workflow dependency, with users treating ChatGPT as an integrated life assistant rather than a specialized tool. However, the findings are limited to urban professionals in English recruited through social media networks and require larger demographic validation.

## Research Questions

1. How do English-speaking urban professionals in India authentically interact with ChatGPT in their daily workflows and personal contexts?

2. What behavioral adaptation strategies emerge to navigate cultural context limitations?

3. How does authentic usage differ from patterns documented in controlled studies or self-reported surveys?

4. What evidence exists for mature AI adoption versus experimental usage within this demographic?

## Methodology

### Data Collection Approach
- **Primary Method**: Retrospective prompt collection via anonymous Google Forms survey
- **Data Request**: "Please share your last 5 prompts to ChatGPT. Copy-paste exactly what you typed - no editing needed!"
- **Key Instruction**: "I want your actual prompts - typos, shortcuts, and all"
- **Recruitment**: Social media networks (LinkedIn professional networks and WhatsApp) in August 2025
- **Anonymization**: 100% anonymous submissions with voluntary participation

### Sample Demographics
- **Total Participants**: 40 complete responses
- **Total Prompts**: 238 individual ChatGPT queries
- **Age Distribution**: 26-35 years (57.5%, n=23), 18-25 years (20%, n=8), 36-45 years (17.5%, n=7), 46-55 years (5%, n=2)
- **Geographic Coverage**: Mumbai (8 users), Bangalore (8 users), Delhi (6 users), plus Pune, Hyderabad, Gurgaon, and other tier-1 and tier-2 cities
- **Usage Frequency**: Daily usage (85%, n=34), few times per week (12.5%, n=5), few times per month (2.5%, n=1)
- **Prompt Response Rate**: 97.5% (39/40 users) provided substantial prompts

## Key Research Findings

### 1. Professional Integration and Daily Dependency
Professional usage emerges as a prominent pattern, with **42.5% (17/40)** of users identifying work tasks as their primary ChatGPT application. This professional focus corresponds with exceptionally high daily usage rates of **85% (34/40)**, substantially exceeding the 28% professional adoption rate documented among employed Americans.

Evidence of real-time workflow integration appears throughout the dataset, with users embedding ChatGPT queries within active work processes, using immediate problem-solving language and referencing ongoing projects.

### 2. Cross-Domain Behavioral Integration  
Analysis of prompt sequences reveals that **most users (32/39 with substantial prompts)** demonstrate usage patterns spanning multiple domains, seamlessly transitioning between professional tasks, health advice, creative projects, and learning within their ChatGPT sessions. This suggests mature AI adoption where users integrate ChatGPT across life domains rather than treating it as a specialized tool.

### 3. Cultural Context Navigation Strategies
Users develop strategies to provide cultural context in their prompts to overcome ChatGPT's limitations with Indian-specific information. Analysis reveals prompts containing:
- Geographic specificity ("in Mumbai", "3BHK design")
- Cultural modifiers ("for Indian men") 
- Economic context (lakhs, crores)
- Traditional practices ("sendha namak", "karva chauth")
- Hindi terminology (ahar, vihar, gaj)

**User-Identified Cultural Challenges**: 62.5% (25/40) of participants provided cultural observations, including:
- "Indian use case differs due to lack of ground-level data"
- "Indians want pizza in 10 minutes, that's how they use ChatGPT" (speed expectations)
- "Hindi belt artists use it to make presentations on their own" (democratization effect)

### 4. Trust-Based Advisory Relationships
Beyond transactional usage, users develop advisory relationships with ChatGPT for sensitive personal guidance, including health consultation patterns and personal decision support for relationship guidance and family situations.

**Economic Context**: User observation reveals, "People using it for therapy should not be shamed; therapy in India is expensive," indicating AI adoption may partly result from limited access to affordable professional services.

### 5. Language and Communication Patterns
**All 238 prompts (100%) use English or Hinglish** despite ChatGPT's multilingual capabilities. Communication style favors directness, with users predominantly employing imperative statements, questions and descriptive language with minimal politeness markers.

**Prompt Sophistication**: Average prompt length of approximately 1,080 characters substantially exceeds the 296-character average documented in the WildChat global dataset, suggesting users in this sample employ detailed context specification strategies.

| **Professional Primary Usage** | 42.5% (17/40 users) | Higher than global averages |
| **Cross-Domain Integration** | 82.1% (32/39 users) | Novel finding |
| **Cultural Observations Provided** | 62.5% (25/40 users) | User-generated insights |
| **Prompt Response Rate** | 97.5% (39/40 users) | High engagement indicator |
| **Language Usage** | 100% English/Hinglish | Despite multilingual capabilities |

## Sample Limitations and Study Constraints

### Critical Limitations
- **Sample Size**: 40 users significantly limits statistical generalizability
- **Demographic Bias**: Social media recruitment overrepresents English-speaking urban professionals
- **Language Bias**: 100% English/Hinglish usage misses Hindi and regional language adoption patterns
- **Geographic Concentration**: Urban-focused, limited rural representation
- **Age Group Reliability**: Insights about 46-55 group unreliable (n=2)

### Methodological Constraints
- **Temporal Scope**: Single-point data collection (August 2025) provides snapshot rather than longitudinal tracking
- **Qualitative Analysis**: Categorizations reflect author's interpretations and lack inter-rater reliability validation
- **Context Limitations**: Individual prompts lack full conversation context
- **Self-Selection Bias**: Voluntary participation may favor engaged users

**Generalizability**: Findings apply specifically to English-speaking urban professionals who use social media platforms and may not generalize to broader Indian populations.

## Future Research Directions

### Scale and Demographic Validation
Large-scale replication studies with minimum 200+ users across linguistic, economic, and geographic segments are essential for validating observed patterns. Priority areas include:
- Hindi and regional language usage studies
- Rural representation
- Cross-platform behavioral comparisons

### Methodological Improvements
- Systematic qualitative coding procedures with inter-rater reliability
- Operational definitions for key constructs (cross-domain usage, cultural context)
- Longitudinal tracking to understand adoption progression

### Cross-Cultural Comparative Studies
Systematic comparison across demographically matched samples from different cultural and economic contexts could illuminate whether observed patterns reflect cultural, economic, or demographic factors.
